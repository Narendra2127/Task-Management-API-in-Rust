Task Management API in Rust
Project Overview
This project is a Task Management API built using the Rocket framework in Rust. It provides basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tasks. Each task includes an id, description, and a completed status. The API serves as a simple introduction to building web applications with Rust.

Features
Create Task: Add a new task with a description and completion status.
Get Tasks: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
Update Task: Modify a task's description or completion status.
Delete Task: Remove a task by its unique id.
Technologies Used
Rust: The programming language used to build the API.
Rocket Framework: A web framework for Rust that makes it easy to develop fast and secure web applications.
Serde: A library for serializing and deserializing data in JSON format.
Mutex: Ensures safe data handling across multiple requests in a concurrent environment.
